I write this post to memory the life living in Ottawa.


#### My experience in English Conversation Group ####

Sep 20, 2017

Martin knew that I will go back to China this week, so he invited me to have dinner together yesterday. He is not able to come to ECG as today is the Jewish New Year. Well, it seems to be the last chance to be a participant of ECG. I talk to Janice jointly with two Chinese people that I knew before. We find some topics that we are all interested in. For example, the most embarrassing time that happens to you, the pets that you own, reading English books or tv series and so on. If you can find the appropriate topics, you will never be afraid to have a conversation with the other person. When I left the room, Mo came to talk to me and ask when I will go back. After telling her that I will leave this Saturday, she gave me the best wishes. When I was just leaving the building, Jane stopped me and said goodbye to me. I was really moved. During the whole year living in Ottawa, what I learned most is to be a nice person and take care of the others as much as you can. I will miss you all!

A few weeks ago, I went bicycling with Martin. This week, we met with each other again. He told me something about how he used to work as a lawyer. And I told him why I want to learn English well. He gave the same idea that English comes from different languages such as Latin, French, and German. We also exchanged the ideas of being a visitor to a country where people speak the language you do not speak. He said it is fine. You just can not do things in a rush and simple things get complicated. Let's see the pic from us. :)

Michael is the third lawyer that I have met in the English conversation group. He is also a man with full of energy. First, we introduced ourselves to each other and then he asked me what I wanted to talk. I told him what does he think of his job since I am really curious about what the daily life of being a layer. However, from his description, I know a lawyer is not always to be in a court as usually shown on TV. He just helps the government to make progress. I also ask him how he found his wife. He described it very simple. They knew each other from work and he thought her accent is very attractive. When the girl moved to Halifax for a promotion, he gave up his job and followed her. He did not show any unpleasant emotions for this because he said the job was boring. In fact, it doubts whether he thought in that way. For me, I turn to understand that love is self-sacrifice. Try to make your partner happy!

I met George tonight. He said that what he wanted to do is to make me speak more. What a nice guy! He just knows what can interest me. He asked me a few questions about the ideal girlfriend in my mind. Beautiful? Hairstyle? Height? Weight? These kind of things are the most important to think clearly. His girlfriend is Chinese and he told me that she spoils his son a lot. Every time he told his girlfriend about this thing. She seemed not very happy. He is also an economist like Haig. Because of his girlfriend, he must be very interested in Chinese culture. That's fine.

The futurist Calvin talked to me tonight. This man is full of energy and always wants to make things clear in his mind. The way he expresses ideas is very impressive to me. From him, you can see the real enthusiastic to reading and writing. He told me his family came from Ireland because of the famine. And his parents are very open minded. They always ask passengers to come to their house for a cup of coffee and talked with them. This made Calvin meet all kinds of people and know the world from different angles. He told me he is writing a book recently. Good luck to you!

Beth is short for Elizabeth. We talk about the university entrance exam in China and the daily life in Beijing. She is very good at talking and curious about many things. During our talking, I can alway see her smiles. Though life may not be as nice as it seems to be, we should have the courage to take it on. At last, she even taught me how to approach a girl. "Do you want a cup of coffee?" :)

Bruce who was a civil engineer now becomes a writer. Enjoy his stories on the website [oldlayabout](https://oldlayabout.wordpress.com/) and [Old Ottawa South Community Association](http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/). His family came to Canada from Scotland because the old government occupied the land of people for industrial revolution. He likes traveling to strange places which he is not familiar with. He told me people are kind everywhere and do not need the worry what has not come yet. It is very important to visit some new places because this may change the way you live. Meeting new people and knowing new things is good for all of us. Remember to be an interesting person.

I talked to Eva again. She gave me a further explanation of her career. The difference of social and economic situation (How to apply the medical knowledge from Canada to Africa.) And she told me her solution for the gender problem in ICAO. Keep learning new things and changing the way you think. As suggested by Eva, I think I will buy a bike to explore the city.

Bill is going to celebrate his 80 birthday in the next month. He was born in a family of 22 people in both his mother and father side. His mother's family came to Canada from French 400 years ago. His father's family came from Scotland 200 years ago. He spent 8 years for two degrees of commerce and lawyer. We talked about house price in both China and Canada. He told me that he bought his first house when he was 45. He and his wife who is a professor separately paid the bill. So he is joking that I should also find a wife whose job is a professor. At the end of our conversation, he told me to he likes drinking Tsingtao Beer instead of Canadian beer. Wow, I am proud of my hometown.

Mo is a strong woman. The flower on her coat is for remembering her son. People are unique and they all have their beautiful lives.

Eva has been to more than 129 countries. She got her PhD. in New York University. She also has her own consultant business. Right now, she works for ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) of UN. She told me a few tips on how to solve problems efficiently. One point is to think in a logic way and the other is to express yourself correctly. Logic way means you do not need to be creative at first. What you need is to give a proper pipeline (A->B->C) instead of (A->C->B->C). Expressing also help you think things clearly and you'd better not use jargons very often. The most important thing is she love her job and feel excited on keep solving problems and giving ideas. She is great.

I talked with Danielle today. And thank her for giving us a cup of mapple syrup. It tastes goood. During our conversation, we talked about the animals, such as bear, moose, salmon and so on. She is full of energy. Since we know each other before, we did not talk about a lot of our basic information. She asked me whether young people know the history of China. Maybe it's time to read some books about that for all of us.

I am very happy to have a conversation with Tom who is the husband of Jackie. I finally got her name. Tom got his Ph.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania. His major is social system science. During his study, he spent a year and a half for the courses. Then he went back to Canada for working (which is very helpful for his Ph.D. studying). He even made his thesis published as a book. After that, he opened up his own consultant. We talked about the cook, movies (La-La-Land), sports and trip. And I think he is a very genius man. We focused on the methodology of thinking and learning. (60% knowledge from work, 10% knowledge from communication with the others, and 20% knowledge from school.) One thing he told me is people speaking more than their writing and people knowing more than their speaking. That means communicating with people is more efficient than reading for acquiring knowledge. And you'd better ask people questions than just learning to them. At last, we talked about the types of changes which are 'simple', 'complicated' (e.g. space rocket), and complex (e.g. raise a baby). What a scientist! We met some girls from south Korea. They even know the pronunciation of Korea in Chinese.

This woman is full of passion and optimistic for life. She was born in India. For the future of all the children, her father decided to move to Canada which was a very open country at that time. Absolutely, Indian people are hard working and smart. Many of her family got the fellowship of universities (e.g. Cornell, Berkeley) in the US. She got two sons and two daughters. We talked about the life for old people. From our conversation, I can see that parents usually prefer to live with their children if possible. She told me her husband which is so kind and gentleman. He always scarifies himself for people. However, life seems to make a joke on him. This kind man suffer from dementia when he turned older. She comes to see him almost every day. What is love? The story besides you can give you the answer. Best regards to both of you.

Yesterday I talked with a lady. I did not write down her name (Jackie) because I could not find my pen. She is a mother of two sons. We talked about games (her son took the second place in the Warcraft III competition), food (she even cooks chinese food, e.g. ma po tofu), sports (she was basketball player at high school) and many other things. She went to China at 1983 for her honey moon. During the trip, she visited some factories and many cities. At that time, there were a lot of bicycles and only a few cars. While we talking, she corrected me some pronunciation mistakes and show me how to express myself in the right way. I said to her that everyone want to be younger. She denied that. She told me that young people have to worry about a lot of things, such as how to find a job, whom to love, how to buy a house. I think she really enjoys her life in her cottage. Life should be simple. Unfortunately, I am the one to keep others live simple.

Today I was picked by Shirley Taylor. She is a 84 years old lady who used to play piano as her career. One amazing thing is that her granddaughter is 35 years old now. She got 3 children and 5 grandchildren. And many of the grandchildren like skiing and her grandson even teaches ski lessons for young children. Then Nelson Freire joined us. She is a brazil girl who went to France for an internship. After that, she got a fellowship there and met her husband who was assgined to work in France by Canadian goverment. We talked about chinese history and some life things. For example, Nelson's child is fifteen months now, and they talk with three languages (French, Portuguese and English) in family. Well, it is very hard for the child to learn to speak now :)

LYNDA, a lawyer, a mother of two children and a female who loves sports a lot. While talking, you can see her love for the children. Last week, she told her son not to ski in the trees and not to follow his friends who always ski fast. However, bad thing happend. His son hit on a tree on the first trial and broke his leg. She said to me a mother usually has a prominent foresight. She also told me about her daughter who is a vegeterian. Her daughter is a the fourth year university student whose major is art (maybe not accurate). Though she got a driver license, she still has trouble to drive a car. Maybe artists do not drive car by themselves. Back to LYNDA, she is a happy woman and moves to a lot of places (even America) during her life. She grew up in Ottawa and selected the university which is away from home to be independent. She does a lot of sports like skiing, skating and riding bicycle. It must be very exciting to go to university by skating on the river. Moreover, she suggested me to join the winter lude to see the sculptures in Confederation Park. I enjoy talking to you and appreciate your sharing the time with me!

Today I talked to Danielle first. And then another person join us. So most of the time we practiced pronunciation. I think the key point is to speak the word entirely and do not ignore any part of the word. Next time I think I should have a schdule of which topics should be taken considerred and prepare some materials (e.g. pictures, personal information) for introducing myself.

Well, this is the second time for me to join the english conversation group. Today I met Joan, a kind lady who moved to Ottawa two years ago. She has two children, one daughter and one son. Her daughter works for children hospital with focusing on mental health. And Joan now has two grandchildren. The younger one is a girl who is almost one year. And the other one is a boy and he is almost two years and a half. I ask how the two children get along with each other. She said now everything is fine but before that the boy may hit his sister or grab something from her. Then we talk about her son in law, and she told me she likes him and thinks that he is a good person and can fix the house and many other stuff. This may be a little different from china, since we usually care more about money or degree. It is very pleasant for me to get the chance to know a person who may grow up in a very different. Thank you Joan for sharing your life story with me.

I heard about the group from my roomate. Since I was child, I begun to study English. At that time, practicing english speaking is very popular in my hometown Qingdao. Every week, people loving english went to English Corner which is located in qingdao landing stage (栈桥). Fortunately, I had been there by the adive of my father.

The place I went to today is some kind of the same with the English Corner. The first people I met is Haig. I think he is a local resident who was born in Vancouver. He went to British Columbia for education and now works for the Canada goverment. We talked about our hobby and he told me that he likes playing soccer. It is worth noting that he has been to China twice for the northern part and the southern part. What embarrasses me is he even visited more places in China than me. He could always find things that we can talk about which I really should learn from him. During our conversation, he mentioned two problems of my english speaking. One is the pronunciation such as computer "vision" and the other is to make right use of he or she. He also gives me a lot of encouragment and some tips to practice english e.g. listening to TED lecture and make chance to speak to more people. Overall, thank you Haig for your kindly communication!
